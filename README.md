# Datacamp_Investigating-Netflix_movies


This Datacamp project uses Netflix's movie datasets to investigate whether modern films are getting shorter over time. It's an ideal way to test basic Python and pandas skills. Building on initial research, you'll explore Netflix data to see if the average movie duration is indeed declining and uncover any factors that might contribute to this trend.
